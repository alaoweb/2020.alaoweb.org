title: "No Login Needed: Developing a New Library Website on Your Own"
description: "This poster focuses on the development of a new academic library website at a small private university, following a sudden shift to a new university website model. At the beginning of the Fall 2019 semester, the University moved to a new website model that separated its existing website into two: an internal website for current members of the University, and an external website for users outside of the university. Due to this shift almost all of the undergraduate library’s content was placed behind a login barrier on the internal website, which extended the research and information gathering process for current members of the University, and prevented users and researchers from outside the University from accessing it. After discussions with necessary stakeholders and upper administration, it was decided that the undergraduate library would create and manage its own website. This poster chronicles the development and implementation of the new website by a single librarian, and showcases the major issues the librarian tackled during the website’s development."
