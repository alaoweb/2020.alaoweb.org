title: "Transitioning Library Services Online During the COVID19 Pandemic"
description: "This poster session will discuss the steps taken to transition library services to a completely online format during the COVID19 pandemic. Specifically, the poster will describe how reference transactions were quickly moved into the Skype for Business environment in order to be in line with communication technology decisions utilized for student and faculty communication. The poster will then describe how continuing education in the form of online discussion forums and online conferences was utilized to quickly discover best practices for library administration and operations during state-wide quarantine. The poster will then describe how technical services and collection development activities were adjusted to leverage existing digital collections and increase digital holdings. The poster will then describe how virtual outreach is utilized in the form of classroom visits via Skype and mass student emails to provide information literacy instruction and make students and faculty aware of virtual library resources and services."
